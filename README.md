## General Information
- This project focuses on analyzing the factors influencing loan defaults in the lending industry.
- The business problem addressed here is identifying risky loan applicants who are more likely to default, thereby helping lenders reduce credit losses.
- The dataset used contains historical loan data from 2007 to 2011, with attributes related to borrower demographics, financial standing, loan characteristics, and payment history.
- The analysis involves exploring borrower attributes (e.g., income, credit history) and loan attributes (e.g., loan amount, term, interest rates) to derive actionable insights.

## Conclusions
- Borrowers with higher **debt-to-income (DTI)** ratios are more likely to default.
- Applicants with shorter credit histories and higher delinquency rates show a greater tendency to default.
- Loans with higher interest rates and longer terms are more prone to defaults.
- Certain loan purposes, such as small business loans, exhibit higher default rates compared to others.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas 1.3.0
